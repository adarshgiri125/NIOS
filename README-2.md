THEME 3 - NIOS has all the resources parents need to homeschool their children.

But their UI is not at all intuitive. There is no easy-to-follow guide. It is not supplemented with other free resources from around the Internet

Transform it and other such guides into a step-by-step roadmap for a parent to homeschool their kid successfully.




## How will we solve the problem
- After looking at the problem statement we felt that, we can improve the UI and make it easy to use in an interative way by making a cross platform App for it(which would work on any devices from web to android and IOS ).

- We have make the website as per the topic listed in Hack to Educate. We have to focus on the real problem on the topic, for making better UI easy to implementing for Parents and Student as well.
- This is an Elearning website that after creating an account will let you learn different subject.
- we will arrange all the feature of details in a proper manner that a parent and student can easily go through.
